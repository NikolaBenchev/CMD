# CMD
A console application in which you can modify existing files and folders.
Folders are going to contain multiple files and folders. Some files are gonna be executable, others
are going to contain plain text.
All of your files and folders are gonna be saved when you exit the terminal.
It will include functions such as:
  - create
  - delete
  - rename
  - move
  - run / enter
  - get size
  - change content
## Future
Maybe in the future you are going to be able to connect to my own database project
